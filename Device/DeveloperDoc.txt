The Device class stores device information, whether it is a device or a Pcap file. An overloaded constructor is provided to allow the user to directly instantiate the device object with a device name and whether the device is a device or a Pcap file. The class also allows these data to be set at a later time through setDevice(). Moreover, these data can also be gathered through getDevice() that returns a device name in the form of a string object, isDevice() that returns 1 is the object stores a device or 0 if it stores a Pcap file, isValid() that returns 1 if device exists or 0 if it does not.

A class that aids with device lookups is the DevicesLookup class is also implemented. Upon construction of a DevicesLookup object, all devices are found and their information is stored in a dynamically-allocated pcap_if_t variable called alldevs. This information can be retrieved at a later time with some of the implemented functions. An overloaded [] operator is one of those. The user can passed in an index of a device array or a name of a device into the operator and a pcap_if_t will be returned. The isValid() function is used to check whether a passed in device name exists in the system, in which 1 will be returned or 0 otherwise. printAllDevices() prints out all existing devices in the system.
