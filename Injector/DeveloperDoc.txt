The Injector class of PacMan performs injection of packet data into the network through an established device. There would have to be an existing device, otherwise an exception would be thrown when a the injector is being declared. A handle is also used to indicate session of an opened device. This feature is encapsulated inside the injector object.

The Injector class is designed so that the user can define the device and packet data in different ways. The constructor is overloaded so that the user can instantiate an Injector object by using the overloaded constructor by passing in the device name and the packet data or set this set of information at a later time. There are two types of packet data. One is the PacketBuffer object and the other one is the Packet object. PacketBuffer object contains mostly an array of uint8_t along with the size of the array. Packet object is more sophisticated and contains packet parsing information, i.e. how the packet data might be parsed into specific fields depending on how they are specified (such as Ipv4 packets), as explained in the Packet section.

Furthermore, the Injector class provides capability to set the device name and packet data (both types) at any time. The inject() function is the one that ultimately allows injection to be performed.
